# Drone_Tracking_Pursuit
# Drone Tracking & Pursuit Simulations

This repository contains two Python-based drone simulation projects:

1. **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) Drone Tracking**  
   A simulation where a drone estimates the position and speed of a moving target using range-only measurements and an Extended Kalman Filter.

2. **Drone Pursuit Simulation**  
   A simulation where a chaser drone attempts to intercept a moving target using basic pursuit logic.

Both simulations include animated visualizations saved as `.mp4` files.
